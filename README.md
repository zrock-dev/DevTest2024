# Dev Test Challenge 2024
**Preparation guidelines**
 
## Introduction
In this document, you will find an introduction to help you understand the process and rules of the development test. It also includes some tips and resources to help you get ready. Make sure to go through the links and materials carefully so you are well-prepared for the tasks ahead.
 
## What is the Dev-test?
The dev test is designed to evaluate your software development skills. This time, the challenge will focus on web application development through two main areas:
 
1. **Area 1 - Backend:** You will build a RESTful API from scratch using the technology stack you are most comfortable with (e.g., Spring Boot, ASP.NET Core, Express.js, Django). You will also need to store data, using in-memory structures (like lists or dictionaries) or a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB).
 
2. **Area 2 - Frontend:** This area focuses on UI development. You will be given designs to replicate in terms of styles, and the UI you create will connect to an existing API. You can use the stack of your choice, like React, Angular, or just plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
 
The challenge will be sent on the same day as the Dev test. It will be divided into backend and frontend tasks. You will have around 4 hours to complete both, so it's important to choose your tech stack carefully to make the most progress.
 
The dev test will cover full-stack development, meaning all exercises will be divided into tasks for both backend and frontend. Each task contributes to a total score of 100%. Your goal is to complete the challenge by addressing all the frontend and backend tasks.
 
## How will the Dev-test be conducted?
The dev test will be done remotely, so you’ll need to join a call at the set date and time. Once on the call, we’ll ask you to turn on your camera and share your screen while you work on the problems. You are allowed to use online resources like articles and official documentation, but you cannot use code-generating tools (AI). If you refer to external documentation, we’ll ask you to share what you’re looking at on the screen.
 
During the test, Jalasoft engineers will join the call to understand your solution, provide support, and clarify any questions. At the end, you’ll have a short demo to show how far you got and explain your thought process.
 
Once the test is over, you’ll need to upload your code to a repository provided by us, which will be reviewed for cleanliness, organization, folder structure, and good development practices.
 
## What are the Requirements for the Dev-test?
1. **Be punctual:** It's important to join the meeting on time so you're ready to receive instructions from the start.
 
2. **Development Environment:** Make sure your setup is ready for both API and UI development, having the necessary tools installed and ready to go. You can use any tools or technology you prefer, but remember you'll be creating an API from scratch and building a UI from given designs. Some examples are:
   - Java, Maven, Python, .NET, Node.js, NPM, Gradle, etc. (depending on your chosen stack).
   - A tool to test your API, like Postman.
   - MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL (choose one).
   - Visual Studio, Eclipse, VSCode, PyCharm, etc. (depending on your chosen stack).
 
## Final Recommendations
The Dev test is designed to find talent, so we encourage you to showcase as many skills as possible. We recommend reviewing the following topics:
- Writing clean code and following best development practices.
- Developing and testing REST APIs using a framework, depending on the tech stack you choose for the test.
- UI development (HTML, CSS, JS, TS); you can also use libraries and frameworks like Vue.js, React.js, Angular, as well as tools like Bootstrap, Material UI, etc., depending on the tech stack you choose for the test.
- If you’re not familiar with Git, we suggest learning basic commands like cloning projects, adding commits, and uploading code.
- To practice, implement the backend of a web application. For practice purposes, you can try to replicate the following application: [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
